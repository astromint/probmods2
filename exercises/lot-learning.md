## Exercise 1: Inferring Functions

Consider our model of function inference from the chapter.
We can reconceptualize our program as a sequence-generator by making the input arguments 1,2,3,â€¦.
Suppose that the first number in the sequence `f(1)` is 1 and the second number `f(2)` is 4.
What number would come next?

### Exercise 1.1

Why is the probability of `x * 2` is so much lower than `x * x`?

HINT: Think about the probability assigned to `x ^ 2`.

### Exercise 1.2

Not surprisingly, the model predicts `9` as the most likely result for `f(3)`.
However, it also puts significant probability on `27`.
Explain why these two numbers have the highest posterior probabilities.

### Exercise 1.3

Many people find the high probability assigned to `27` to be unintuitive (i.e. if we ran this as an experiment, 27 would be a very infrequent response).
This suggests our model is an imperfect model of human intuitions. How could we decrease the probability of inferring `27`?

HINT: Consider the priors. 


## Exercise 2: Role-governed concepts (optional)

In the Rational Rules model we saw in the chapter, concepts were defined in terms of the features of single objects (e.g. "it's a raven if it has black wings").
Psychologists have suggested that many concepts are not defined by the features of a single objects, but instead by the relations the object has to other objects.
For instance, "a key is something that opens a lock".
These are called *role-governed* concepts.

Extend the Rational Rules model to capture role-governed concepts.

Hint: You will need primitive relations in your language of thought.

Hint: Consider adding quantifiers (e.g. *there exists*) to your language of thought.
